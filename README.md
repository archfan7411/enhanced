# enhanced
Minetest mod which allows players to enhance tools.

# How to use
Enhanced tools dig/cut/whatever 20% faster, and also deal 20% more damage (rounded up to an integer.)

For example, a normal diamond sword deals 8 hitpoints of damage, while an enhanced diamond sword deals 10 hitpoints of damage.

Enhanced tools are crafted very simply - place the normal tool + one mese crystal in the crafting grid.
